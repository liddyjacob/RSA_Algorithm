An RSA Implimentation using Matt McCutchen's Big Integer Library. 
For more details, check out: http://mattmccutchen.net/bigint/

Also, signs documents to test the implimentation. For this we use
the zedwood.com implimentation. BSD Liscense.

For Algorithms(435). And fun.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

* Always do a make clean, then a make
============
```
  make clean
  make
```
============

* To generate the key, just run rsa435
============
```
  ./rsa435
```
============
p_q will be the primes, and d_n.txt e_n are private and 
public keys respectivly.

* To sign a file, just use the following command:
============
```
  ./sign s (filename)
```
============

* To verify the signature, use the following command:
============
```
  ./sign v (signedfile)
```
============
